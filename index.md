## About me:
I am a postdoctoral researcher at ISTerre, CNRS, France, working with Prof. [Nikolai Shapiro](https://sites.google.com/view/nikolai-shapiro-web-site/accueil/nikolai-shapiro-cv). 

Before joining ISTerre, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of Tokyo, working with Prof. [Satoshi Ide](https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/people/ide_satoshi/). 

I received my Ph.D. from the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University, where I was advised by Prof.  [Han Yue](http://geophy.pku.edu.cn/pubtphp/yuehan/english/) and Prof. [Lian Xue](https://sites.google.com/site/lianxuelx/home).  During my Ph.D. studies, I was also a long-term visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo (October 2023 – July 2025), under the supervision of Prof. [Satoshi Ide](https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/people/ide_satoshi/).
 
I am interested in observational seismology and earthquake physics. 

 My recent research activities are posted on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weifan-Lu-2) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LBrFx5gAAAAJ&hl=en)
