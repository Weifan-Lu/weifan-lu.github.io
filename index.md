## About me:

 I am a PhD student in the School of Earth and Space Science at Peking University, working with Prof. [Han Yue](http://geophy.pku.edu.cn/pubtphp/yuehan/english/) and Prof. [Lian Xue](http://geophy.pku.edu.cn/people/xuelian/).  
 
Currently, I am a long-term Visiting PhD student at the University of Tokyo (From 2023.10-now). My advisor is Prof. [Satoshi Ide](https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/people/ide_satoshi/).
 
I am interested in observational seismology and earthquake physics. 

 My recent research activities are posted on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weifan-Lu-2) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LBrFx5gAAAAJ&hl=en)
