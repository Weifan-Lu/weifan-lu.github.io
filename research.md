Understanding the earthquake nucleation process has direct implications for earthquake physics and seismic hazards. To address this issue, I investigate earthquake nucleation by using seismicity and seismic waveform analysis.
### Earthquake nucleation process
Pairs of co-located large and small earthquakes that share almost identical seismic wave onsets more frequently occur on simple fault than complex fault systems, according to an analysis of 24 years of seismic records from Northern California\
