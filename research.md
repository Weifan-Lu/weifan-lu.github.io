Understanding the earthquake nucleation process has direct implications for earthquake physics and seismic hazards. To address this issue, I investigate earthquake nucleation by using seismicity and seismic waveform analysis.
### Earthquake nucleation process
Pairs of co-located large and small earthquakes that share almost identical seismic wave onsets more frequently occur on simple fault than complex fault systems, according to an analysis of 24 years of seismic records from Northern California\

### Earthquake and Tide
The response of seismicity to solid Earth tides sheds light on the physical processes and properties controlling earthquake triggering. I have developed a program designed to explore the correlation between earthquakes and tides.
